# BlockHarbor Proving Ground - Founding Fathers

**Category:** OSINT<br>
**Points:** 5

## TL;DR

A straightforward OSINT challenge requiring basic Google search skills to find BlockHarbor's founding year. While seemingly simple, it demonstrates the importance of verifying information from reliable sources and shows how even basic OSINT skills can be valuable in CTF challenges.

## The Journey

You know those moments when you see a challenge and think "This has got to be a trick question"? That's exactly what went through my mind when I first saw this one. I mean, come on - just Google the founding year? _There's gotta be more to it, right?_

### Initial Approach

First things first, I went with the most obvious approach (sometimes the simple way is the right way!):

1.  **Google Search Query:** "When was Block Harbor founded?"
2.  **Result:** Found that BlockHarbor was established in **2014**

### Verification

Even though this was a low-point challenge, I've learned from past CTFs that it's always good practice to:

-   _Cross-reference information_ when possible
-   **Check multiple sources** to confirm the date
-   Look for any potential _red herrings_

## Flag

The answer was straightforward: `2014`

## Lessons Learned

Even though this was just a 5-pointer, it reinforced some important OSINT principles:

-   **Don't overcomplicate things** - sometimes the obvious approach is correct
-   _Always verify your findings_ - even if it seems too easy
-   Basic OSINT skills are fundamental and shouldn't be overlooked

## Tips for Similar Challenges

-   Start with the obvious before diving into complex techniques
-   **Document your search process** - it helps for future reference
-   _Don't ignore low-point challenges_ - they often teach fundamental skills
