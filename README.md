# CTF-Writeups

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is where I document my journey through the Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges I participate in. Each writeup breaks down how I approached and solved different problemsâ€”whether it's web, mobile, reversing, pwn, crypto, or forensics.

Iâ€™m doing this not only to sharpen my skills, but also to give back to the community thatâ€™s taught me so much. Hopefully, these notes can help fellow CTFers learn, debug, or just get inspired.

Feel free to explore, learn, or even drop me a note if youâ€™ve got ideas or questions. Letâ€™s get better together!
